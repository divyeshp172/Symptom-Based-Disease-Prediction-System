# 🏥 Symptom-Based Disease Prediction and Clinical Support System

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Symptom-Based Disease Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based healthcare application designed to predict possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms.

This system analyzes symptom patterns using supervised learning algorithms and provides:

- Predicted Disease
- Disease Description
- Severity Analysis
- Suggested Precautions

⚠️ Note: This project is developed for educational purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a multi-class disease classification model.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on medical symptom datasets.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models.
- Provide an interactive interface for users to input symptoms.
- Deliver disease prediction along with precautionary measures.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The project uses structured medical datasets containing:

- Disease-Symptom mapping dataset
- Symptom Severity dataset
- Disease Description dataset
- Precaution dataset

Each disease is associated with multiple symptoms, enabling multi-class classification.
